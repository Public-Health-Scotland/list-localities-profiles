**Summary**

For the most recent time period available, `r LOCALITY` Locality had:

-   **`r n_houses`** dwellings, of which: **`r perc_occupied`%** were occupied and **`r perc_second_homes`%** were second homes.
-   **`r perc_single_discount`%** of dwellers received a single-occupant council tax discount, and **`r perc_exempt`%** were exempt from council tax entirely.
-   **`r perc_houses_AC`%** of houses were within council tax bands A to C, and **`r perc_houses_FH`%** were in bands F to H.

\newline

The graph below shows the number of dwellings in `r LOCALITY` from `r min(house_dat$year)` to `r max_year_housing`.

figure_num <- figure_num + 1
```

Of the total number of dwellings in `r max_year_housing`, `r perc_single_discount`% (`r n_single_discount` households) were occupied by an individual receiving a single-occupant council tax discount. Furthermore, `r perc_exempt`% (`r n_exempt` households) were occupied and exempt from council tax.

There were `r n_second_homes` dwellings classed as a second home in `r max_year_housing`, these dwellings made up `r perc_second_homes`% of the households in `r LOCALITY`.
