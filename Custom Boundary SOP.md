# Custom Boundaries SOP

## Requirements

-   A set of boundaries that are coherent with Intermediate Zones - This means the custom boundaries must be at one Intermediate Zone in size and **must** be made up of complete Intermediate Zones.

## Process

1.  Get the new lookups in order.
2.  Create a new data folder and update variables in a handful of places to reflect this.
3.  Run the MSG code in the Unscheduled Care folder to get MSG data at IZ-level.
4.  Run the Unscheduled Care 1 file to produce the data files needed.
5.  Run the General Health 1 file to produce data files needed.
6.  Run the full indicators as usual.
