This is the code used to produce the Locality Profiles.

### Directories

- The code for Locality Profiles can be found on GitHub at [Public-Health-Scotland/list-localities-profiles](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/list-localities-profiles). The latest version, which is mostly tested, will be on the `main` branch. The specific code used in each release can be found by checking the releases section.

- The code for HSCP Profiles is available in the forked repository [Public-Health-Scotland/list-hscp-profiles](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/list-hscp-profiles). This repository is maintained as a fork, allowing any relevant changes made to the Locality Profiles to be synchronised.

- Code for 'custom profiles', which are defined at boundaries other than Locality, is currently maintained on branches within the [Locality Profiles repo](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/list-localities-profiles). A few draft Pull Requests are kept open to facilitate easy reference.

- Both input and output data can be located on the stats drive at: `\\stats\LIST_analytics\West Hub\02 - Scaled Up Work\RMarkdown\Locality Profiles\`

  - Each chapter has its folder used to save input data before a release. The folders include: `Demographics`, `General Health`, `Households`, `Lifestyle & Risk Factors`, `Services`, and `Unscheduled Care`.

  - The `Master RMarkdown Document & Render Code\Output` folder is designated for saving all outputs.

  - The `Final Profiles` folder (and its subdirectories) is used to store completed profiles and related files that are ready for access by LIST colleagues.
