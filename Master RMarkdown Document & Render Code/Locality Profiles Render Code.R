##Loop to create the profiles for all the localities in the list

## There are several stages to the profiles:
    # 1. Producing the HSCP services map (this takes a while to run so it is produced separately)
    # 2. Looping through each locality in the HSCP doing the following:
          #2a. Run each section script for that locality
          #2b. Run the Rmd for the main body of the profiles
          #2c. Run the Rmd for the summary tables

# 2. Loop through each locality to create the main body of the profiles and the summary table
