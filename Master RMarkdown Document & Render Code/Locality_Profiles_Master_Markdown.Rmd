### Deprivation

The following section explores the deprivation structure of `r LOCALITY` through the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). The SIMD ranks all datazones in Scotland by a number of factors; Access, Crime, Education, Employment, Health, Housing and Income. Based on these ranks, each datazone is then given an overall deprivation rank, which is used to split datazones into Deprivation Quintiles (Quintile 1 being the most deprived, and Quintile 5 the least). The most recent SIMD ranking was carried out in 2020. This section mainly focuses on the SIMD 2020 classifications, however, the 2016 classifications are used to assess how deprivation has changed in `r LOCALITY` when compared to the rest of Scotland.

Of the `r pop_max_year` population in `r LOCALITY`, **`r perc_bottom_quintile`%** live in the most deprived Quintile (SIMD 1), and **`r perc_top_quintile`%** live in the least deprived Quintile (SIMD 5).

Figure `r x` presents a comparison between the 2016 SIMD ranking applied to 2016 population estimates, and the more recent 2020 SIMD ranking applied to `r pop_max_year` population estimates. The percentages of the population living within each SIMD quintile by domain were calculated using the 2016 and 2020 SIMD datazone classifications respectively. The differences in these percentages are plotted in Figure `r x`. Negative values on the y-axis indicate a decrease in the percent of the population living within a quintile, while positive values indicate an increase in the percent of the population living within a quintile. **Please note that quintiles have been weighted by the Scottish population so, any local changes in SIMD quintile do not necessarily indicate a difference in deprivation, but rather a difference in deprivation in comparison to the rest of Scotland.**

## Lifestyle and Risk Factors

\newline

**Summary**

Mental and physical well-being has close ties with people's lifestyles and behaviours. Financial security, employment and location are influences that often have a bearing on these choices. Issues can develop when alcohol, smoking or drug use shape lives. This section provides data on drug-related hospital admissions, alcohol-related hospital admissions, alcohol-specific deaths and bowel screening uptake, to give an overview of some of the lifestyles and behaviours for the `r LOCALITY` locality. These can give an idea of quality of life and prosperity.

For the most recent time period available^3^, `r LOCALITY` had:

-   **`r format_number_for_text(alcohol_hosp_latest)`** alcohol-related hospital admissions per 100,000 age-sex standardised population. This is `r alcohol_hosp_diff_scot` than Scotland (`r  format_number_for_text(scot_alcohol_hosp)` admissions per 100,000)^4^.
-   **`r format_number_for_text(alcohol_deaths_latest)`** alcohol-specific deaths per 100,000 age-sex standardised population. This is `r alcohol_deaths_diff_scot` than Scotland (`r  format_number_for_text(scot_alcohol_deaths)` deaths per 100,000)^4^.
-   **`r format_number_for_text(drug_hosp_latest)`** drug-related hospital admissions per 100,000 age-sex standardised population. This is `r drug_hosp_diff_scot` than Scotland (`r format_number_for_text(scot_drug_hosp)` admissions per 100,000)^4^.
-   **`r format_number_for_text(bowel_screening_latest)`%** uptake of bowel screening among the eligible population, compared to `r format_number_for_text(scot_bowel_screening)`% in Scotland.

### Alcohol-related Hospital Admissions

In `r latest_period_alcohol_hosp`, the rate of alcohol-related admissions was **`r format_number_for_text(alcohol_hosp_latest)`** per 100,000 age-sex standardised population in `r LOCALITY`. This is `r get_article(alcohol_hosp_change)` `r format_number_for_text(alcohol_hosp_change)`% `r alcohol_hosp_change_word` overall since `r earliest_period_alcohol_hosp`. Figure `r x` shows a trend of alcohol-related hospital admissions for `r LOCALITY` locality compared with Scotland, `r HSCP` HSCP and `r HB` from financial year `r earliest_period_alcohol_hosp` to `r latest_period_alcohol_hosp`.

Figure `r x + 1` then compares different areas, including the other localities in `r HSCP`, for the latest financial year. This bar chart shows that in `r latest_period_alcohol_hosp`, `r LOCALITY` locality had a `r alcohol_hosp_diff_scot` alcohol-related hospital admissions rate compared to Scotland (`r format_number_for_text(alcohol_hosp_latest)` and `r  format_number_for_text(scot_alcohol_hosp)` admissions respectively).

This is `r get_article(drug_hosp_change)` `r format_number_for_text(drug_hosp_change)`% `r drug_hosp_change_word` since `r earliest_period_drug_hosp`. A trend of the change in drug-related hospital admissions for the locality and comparable areas is shown in Figure `r x` from `r earliest_period_drug_hosp` onward.

A comparison of areas at the most recent time period (`r latest_period_drug_hosp` aggregated financial years) is available in Figure `r x + 1` This shows the `r LOCALITY` locality has a `r drug_hosp_diff_scot` rate of drug-related hospital admissions than Scotland (`r format_number_for_text(scot_drug_hosp)` admissions per 100,000).

### Bowel Screening Uptake

Bowel screening is offered every two years to eligible men and women aged between 50-74 years old. Eligible people are posted a test kit which is completed at home. Since 1st April 2013, those aged 75 and over can also self-refer and opt into screening.

A trend of the percentage uptake of bowel screening among the eligible population is shown for `r LOCALITY` and comparable areas. Data is presented as 3-year aggregates. The `r latest_period_bowel_screening` uptake rate for `r LOCALITY` is **`r format_number_for_text(bowel_screening_latest)`%**. This is `r get_article(bowel_screening_change)` `r format_number_for_text(bowel_screening_change)`% `r bowel_screening_change_word` since `r earliest_period_bowel_screening`. As can be seen in Figure `r x + 1`, in the latest estimate, the uptake in `r LOCALITY` was `r bowel_screening_diff_scot` than the uptake in Scotland overall (`r format_number_for_text(scot_bowel_screening)`%).

### Footnotes

1.  The National Records Scotland (NRS) does not currently provide population projections at the locality level. To explore how the population in `r LOCALITY` is expected to change in the future, the percent changes in population projection to 2025 for `r HSCP` by age group and gender were calculated using the NRS Local Authority Population Projections. These percent changes were then applied to the `r LOCALITY` 2022 mid-year population estimates (also split by age group and gender) to obtain population projection estimates for `r LOCALITY`, based on the projections for the HSCP and the current population structure of the locality.

2.  Care Home data included in the Services Map and Table was sourced from the [Care Inspectorate](https://www.careinspectorate.com/index.php/about-us). [GP Practice](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-contact-details-and-list-sizes), [Hospital](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/hospital-codes) and [A&E](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/nhs-scotland-accident-emergency-sites) data were sourced from Public Health Scotland Open Data platform. Only services within the physical boundary of the HSCP or Locality are included in the map and table, so there may be services outside `r HSCP` that residents use but are not shown. Information on access deprivation was taken from the [ScotPHO profiles](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/ScotPHO_profiles_tool/) (The Scottish Public Health Observatory).

4.  ScotPHO data is often reported using the European Age-Sex Standardised Rate per 100,000. This allows for comparisons across different areas to be made. For more information on how these rates are calculated, please refer to the [PHS website: Geography, population and deprivation support](https://publichealthscotland.scot/services/geography-population-and-deprivation-support/population/){.uri}.

5.  Data on physical long-term conditions (LTC) is sourced from the Source Linkage Files (SLFs). These conditions are identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes found in inpatient admissions' diagnosis fields for acute and mental health cases. Note that this data does not include all service users in Scotland diagnosed with an LTC, as not all of these individuals have utilized these services. Additionally, LTC rates are based on an adjusted population indicator in the Source Linkage Files, ensuring that the population sizes align more closely with official estimates.
