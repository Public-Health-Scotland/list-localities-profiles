## Demographics

\newline

**Summary**

For the most recent time period available, `r LOCALITY` Locality had:

+ A total population of **`r total_population`** people, where **`r gender_breakdown[gender_breakdown$sex == "M",]$perc`** were male, and **`r over65`%** were aged over 65.
+ **`r perc_top_quintile`%** of people lived in the least deprived SIMD quintile, and **`r perc_bottom_quintile`%** lived in the most deprived quintile.

\newline

### Population
<!-- Total Population Text -->
In `r pop_max_year`, the total population of `r LOCALITY` locality was `r total_population`. The graph below shows the population distribution of the locality. Overall, **`r gender_breakdown[gender_breakdown$sex == "M",]$perc`** of the population are male, and **`r gender_breakdown[gender_breakdown$sex == "F",]$perc`** are female.

### Deprivation
The following section explores the deprivation structure of `r LOCALITY` through the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). The SIMD ranks all datazones in Scotland by a number of factors; Access, Crime, Education, Employment, Health, Housing and Income. Based on these ranks, each datazone is then given an overall deprivation rank, which is used to split datazones into Deprivation Quintiles (Quintile 1 being the most deprived, and Quintile 5 the least). The most recent SIMD ranking was carried out in 2020. This section mainly focuses on the SIMD 2020 classifications, however, the 2016 classifications are used to assess how deprivation has changed in `r LOCALITY` when compared to the rest of Scotland.

Of the `r pop_max_year` population in `r LOCALITY`, **`r perc_bottom_quintile`%** live in the most deprived Quintile (SIMD 1), and **`r perc_top_quintile`%** live in the least deprived Quintile (SIMD 5).

Figure `r x` presents a comparison between the 2016 SIMD ranking applied to 2016 population estimates, and the more recent 2020 SIMD ranking applied to `r pop_max_year` population estimates. The percentages of the population living within each SIMD quintile by domain were calculated using the 2016 and 2020 SIMD datazone classifications respectively. The differences in these percentages are plotted in Figure `r x`. Negative values on the y-axis indicate a decrease in the percent of the population living within a quintile, while positive values indicate an increase in the percent of the population living within a quintile. **Please note that quintiles have been weighted by the Scottish population so, any local changes in SIMD quintile do not necessarily indicate a difference in deprivation, but rather a difference in deprivation in comparison to the rest of Scotland.**

## Lifestyle and Risk Factors

\newline

**Summary**

Mental and physical well-being has close ties with peopleâ€™s lifestyles and behaviours. Financial security, employment and location are influences that often have a bearing on these choices. Issues can develop when alcohol, smoking or drug use shape lives. This section provides data on drug-related hospital admissions, alcohol-related hospital admissions, alcohol-specific deaths and bowel screening uptake, to give an overview of some of the lifestyles and behaviours for the `r LOCALITY` locality. These can give an idea of quality of life and prosperity.

For the most recent time period available^3^, `r LOCALITY` had:

- **`r format_number_for_text(alcohol_hosp_latest)`** alcohol-related hospital admissions per 100,000 age-sex standardised population. This is `r alcohol_hosp_diff_scot` than Scotland (`r  format_number_for_text(scot_alcohol_hosp)` admissions per 100,000)^4^.
- **`r format_number_for_text(alcohol_deaths_latest)`** alcohol-specific deaths per 100,000 age-sex standardised population. This is `r alcohol_deaths_diff_scot` than Scotland (`r  format_number_for_text(scot_alcohol_deaths)` deaths per 100,000)^4^.
- **`r format_number_for_text(drug_hosp_latest)`** drug-related hospital admissions per 100,000 age-sex standardised population. This is `r drug_hosp_diff_scot` than Scotland (`r format_number_for_text(scot_drug_hosp)` admissions per 100,000)^4^.
- **`r format_number_for_text(bowel_screening_latest)`%** uptake of bowel screening among the eligible population, compared to `r format_number_for_text(scot_bowel_screening)`% in Scotland.

### Alcohol-related Hospital Admissions

In `r latest_period_alcohol_hosp`, the rate of alcohol-related admissions was **`r format_number_for_text(alcohol_hosp_latest)`** per 100,000 age-sex standardised population in `r LOCALITY`. This is a `r format_number_for_text(alcohol_hosp_change)`% `r alcohol_hosp_change_word` overall since `r earliest_period_alcohol_hosp`. Figure `r x` shows a trend of alcohol-related hospital admissions for `r LOCALITY` locality compared with Scotland, `r HSCP` HSCP and `r HB` from financial year `r earliest_period_alcohol_hosp` to `r latest_period_alcohol_hosp`. 

Figure `r x + 1` then compares different areas, including the other localities in `r HSCP`, for the latest financial year. This bar chart shows that in `r latest_period_alcohol_hosp`, `r LOCALITY` locality had a `r alcohol_hosp_diff_scot` alcohol-related hospital admissions rate compared to Scotland (`r format_number_for_text(alcohol_hosp_latest)` and `r  format_number_for_text(scot_alcohol_hosp)` admissions respectively).

### Bowel Screening Uptake

Bowel screening is offered every two years to eligible men and women aged between 50-74 years old. Eligible people are posted a test kit which is completed at home. Since 1st April 2013, those aged 75 and over can also self-refer and opt into screening.

A trend of the percentage uptake of bowel screening among the eligible population is shown for `r LOCALITY` and comparable areas. Data is presented as 3-year aggregates. The `r latest_period_bowel_screening` uptake rate for `r LOCALITY` is **`r format_number_for_text(bowel_screening_latest)`%**. This is a `r format_number_for_text(bowel_screening_change)`% `r bowel_screening_change_word` since `r earliest_period_bowel_screening`. As can be seen in Figure `r x + 1`, in the latest estimate, the uptake in `r LOCALITY` was `r bowel_screening_diff_scot` than the uptake in Scotland overall (`r format_number_for_text(scot_bowel_screening)`%).

### Footnotes

1. Population projections are not currently provided by NRS at the locality level. To explore how the population in `r LOCALITY` is expected to change in the future, the percent changes in population projection to 2025 for `r HSCP` by age group and gender were calculated from the NRS Local Authority Population Projections. These percent changes were then applied to the `r LOCALITY` 2018 mid-year population estimates (also split by age group and gender) to obtain population projection estimates for `r LOCALITY`, based on the projections for the HSCP and the current population structure of the locality.

2. Care Home Data included in the Services Map and Table was sourced from the [Care Inspectorate](https://www.careinspectorate.com/images/documents/5713/MDSF_data_31%20May%202020.csv). [GP Practice](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-contact-details-and-list-sizes) data from October 2021, and [Hospital](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/hospital-codes) and [A&E](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/nhs-scotland-accident-emergency-sites) data was sourced from Public Health Scotland Open Data. Only services that are within the physical boundary of the HSCP or Locality are included in the map and table, so there may be services outside `r HSCP` that people may use but are not shown. Information on access deprivation was taken from [ScotPHO](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/ScotPHO_profiles_tool/).

3. Sourced from [ScotPHO](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/ScotPHO_profiles_tool/). There may be more recent data available for the indicators elsewhere.

4. Data taken from ScotPHO is often reported using the European Age-Sex Standardised Rate per 100,000. This allows for comparisons across different areas to be made. For more information on how these rates are calculated, please refer to [www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/GPD-Support/Population/Standard-Populations/](https://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/GPD-Support/Population/Standard-Populations/)

5. Physical long-term conditions data comes from the Source Linkage Files, and the conditions are identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes in the diagnosis fields. Please note that the Source Linkage Files data only contains information on people who have had contact with the NHS through either inpatient admissions, outpatient attendances, daycase attendances, A&E attendances or through prescribed items, the data does not show all service users in Scotland who have been diagnosed with an LTC as not all of these individuals will have used these services. Also, note that LTC rates are based on an adjusted population indicator in the Source Linkage Files so that population sizes are closer to the official estimates.
